# my_ftp
A nearly fonctionnal FTP Server written in C during an Epitech Project.
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 x64 and macOS 10.12.
Grade unknown at this time.

# Working :
* `USER`and `PASS` (Supports only `Anonymous` login)
* `PASV`
* `LIST` (No arguments supported)
* `STOR`
* `RETR`
* `DELE`
* `NOOP`
* `PWD`
* `CWD`
* `CDUP`
* `QUIT`
> **Note:** The active mode provided by `PORT` isn't implemented.

> **Remember:** The Epitech's `Moulitriche` will give you a `-42` if you're too inspired by this not so functionnal FTP server. But if you need help, this can help you to realize your project.
